            <h3>Our Methodology</h3>
            <p>We follow a structured and precise methodology to ensure that our findings are comprehensive and actionable. Here’s how we approach OSINT testing and threat modeling:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Discovery Phase:</strong> We start by collecting all relevant publicly available information about your organization using OSINT techniques, from social media profiles to domain records and network infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk Analysis:</strong> After gathering the data, we assess the likelihood of these exposed elements being used in an attack, focusing on key areas such as social engineering and infrastructure vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Threat Modeling:</strong> Based on the gathered intelligence, we create detailed models simulating potential threats that your organization might face and provide solutions to mitigate these risks.</li>
                <li><strong>Reporting & Recommendations:</strong> We provide a detailed report summarizing our findings, with clear steps for remediation and risk mitigation.</li>

        <section class="case-study">
            <h3>Case Study: Experian OSINT Report</h3>
            <p>In a mock investigation for Experian, I conducted an OSINT analysis that uncovered potential vulnerabilities in both organizational and individual-level data. Here’s an overview of the key findings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Organizational Exposure:</strong> The public availability of social media profiles and network infrastructure information elevated the risk of phishing attacks targeting Experian customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Individual Risks:</strong> Personal details about key directors, including contact information and family details, were accessible through OSINT techniques, increasing the risk of social engineering attacks against high-ranking individuals.</li>
                <li><strong>Recommendations:</strong> I advised Experian to implement strict digital footprint reduction measures, provide training for key employees, and remove sensitive data from public platforms where possible.</li>
            </ul>
