            <h3>Notable Projects</h3>
            <h4>Mock OSINT Report on Experian</h4>
            <p>Conducted a detailed OSINT investigation on Experian, identifying potential security and privacy risks from publicly available information. Read the full <a href="URL_TO_EXPERIAN_REPORT" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experian OSINT Report</a> to learn more.</p>

            <h4>Web Application Fuzzer with GUI (QT6 Framework)</h4>
            <p>Developed a fuzzer tool for web applications with a user-friendly graphical interface, designed to identify vulnerabilities through automated testing.</p>

            <h4>Metadata Analyzer (Python)</h4>
            <p>Created a metadata analyzer to assist in generating detailed metadata reports. <a href="https://wizardml7.github.io/metadataAnalyzer">Learn more</a>.</p>

            <h4>ChatCSEC - Undergraduate Capstone Project</h4>
            <p>Developed ChatCSEC, an LLM-based chatbot for computing security education, as part of a group project. Collaborated with a team to design, develop, and deploy the chatbot.</p>

            <h4>Vulnerabilities in Tap-To-Pay Systems</h4>
            <p>Participated in a research project analyzing vulnerabilities in Tap-To-Pay systems. Documented potential security flaws and contributed to a comprehensive research paper.</p>

            <h4>Cuckoo Watchtower</h4>
            <p>Created Cuckoo Watchtower to assist with malware forensics by integrating GPT-4 to analyze Cuckoo Sandbox JSON reports. Enhanced malware analysis with interactive, chatbot-style insights within a Google Colab environment. The tool provided dynamic reporting, interactive querying, and advanced search capabilities using vector databases.</p>

            <h4>AudioCovert</h4>
            <p>Developed AudioCovert, a tool to embed and decode hidden messages in audio files. Encoded messages into WAV files, manipulating high-frequency signals to make them imperceptible to the human ear. Messages were decoded by generating and inspecting the audio file's spectrogram.</p>
